Welcome to our powerful and user-friendly Inventory Management System (IMS), built with PHP and MySQL. Designed for businesses of all sizes, this system simplifies your inventory processes, improves accuracy, and enhances productivity.

ðŸ§  System Overview
Our IMS offers two main panels: Admin and User. Each panel is tailored to meet specific roles and responsibilities, ensuring smooth and secure access to key inventory functions.

Admins can add units of measurement (e.g., kg, liter, piece) used in product packaging and stock tracking.
2. Add New Party
Add and manage party details including name, business name, contact number, email, address, and city. This helps in maintaining client/vendor relationships efficiently.
